Wearable Feedback for Environmental Interpretation

Our team is developing a system of integrated sensors and feedback modules that can be used by a visually impaired individual to better understand complex environments. Important information about their surroundings is acquired, processed, and converted into haptic and auditory feedback that can let the user make informed decisions about how to deal with their invisible surroundings.

Target: Summer 2021
