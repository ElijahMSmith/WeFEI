Running tiny still gives a lot of FPS, not sure the exact number
Should also make sure the bounding boxes are close enough that we can work with it

Finally, should try v4 regular again, now that I shrunk size to 416



NOTE: Must compile v4 to create libdarknet.so, which the following line links to
Run ./runYolo.sh or use the commands below consecutively:

export LIB_DARKNET=/home/wearlabucf/Desktop/WeFEI/YOLOv4/libdarknet.so
python3 test.py
